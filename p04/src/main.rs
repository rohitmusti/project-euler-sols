/*
 * Prompt:
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
 * from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 *
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 *
 * Two possible methods:
 *
 * start from the number
 * we know that the largest possible 3 digit product is 999 * 999
 * so do we just iterate downwards until we find a palindrome and
 * then check for that palindrome's 3 digit factors until we find one w/ two
 * 3-digit factors?
 *
 * start from the factors, try factors until you find the biggest palindrome
